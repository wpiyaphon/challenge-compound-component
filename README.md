# Postcard Compound Component Challenge

This project focuses on refactoring a simple Postcard component into a Compound Component structure. The Postcard consists of three sections: an image, an address, and a submit button.

## Objective

The goal of this challenge is to convert a simple Postcard component into a Compound Component, following the given requirements:

- The Postcard must contain three components: `Image`, `Address`, and `Submit`.
- Users must be able to change the postcard's image by clicking on it.
- After clicking the send button, a loading state should be displayed, preventing the user from changing the image until the process is complete.
